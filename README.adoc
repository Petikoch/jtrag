== Introduction

*jtrag* is is a small, standalone java library on top of https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg].
It adds a "task resource assignment graph" API.

== My motivation to create jtrag

Any "task resource assignment graph" cycle detection problem can be used with a simple "task wait for graph" model:
Just use tasks for resources.
But: A "task resource assignment graph" API is more clear to use *if* you have tasks *and* resources in your domain model.
