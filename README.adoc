== Introduction

*jtrag* is is a small java library on top of https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg].
It adds a "task resource assignment graph" API to the "task wait for graph" API of https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg].

The typical use case for someone is having some kind of own "execution engine" implementation
(local, distributed, grid...) with some kind of tasks and resources in it, with optional dependencies between the tasks and resources.
Someone wants to be able to *easily detect deadlocks* in his/her engine.

jtrag together with jtwfg implements a *graph* model with a *deadlock detection algorithm*.

To use the jtrag/jtwfg deadlock detection, you transform your "execution engine" domain model objects into jtrag/jtwfg graph model objects and call then the jtwfg deadlock detector.

=== Example 1 for a deadlock in a "task resource assignment graph"

A graph consists of *tasks* and *resources*. Resources are assigned to tasks and tasks can be dependent on resources.
As soon as a circular relationship exists, the involved tasks and resources are _deadlocked_.

In this first example you see two tasks and two resources with a circular relationship.

Since they are waiting synchronously for each other *forever*, they are _deadlocked_.

jtrag/jtwfg can analyze such graphs and find the deadlock(s).

=== Example 2 for a deadlock in a "task resource assignment graph"

The situation in the second example is a bit more interesting.

image::many_tasks_deadlocked.png[]

Here, we have a circle consisting of "Task 1", "Resource 1", "Task 2", "Resource 2", "Task 3" and "Resource 3".
Since they are all waiting synchronously for each other *forever*, they are _deadlocked_.
"Task 4" is also _deadlocked_, although it is not in the circle. It is waiting for a _deadlocked_ resource.
Same for "Resource 4" and "Task 5", also _deadlocked_.

"Task 6" is fine.

jtrag/jtwfg can analyze such graphs and tell you

* If there is a deadlock in the graph
* How many deadlock circles exist and which tasks are in them
* What other tasks and resources (outside of a deadlock circle) are also deadlocked

=== Other use cases

Beside of the mentioned classic "custom execution engine" deadlock use case, jtrag/jtwfg can also be used to find any kind of circular dependencies in problem areas like configuration, dependency injection, ...

=== More about the deadlock detection topic in general

For more details about deadlock detection algorithms see e.g. http://se.inf.ethz.ch/old/projects/daniel_moser/project_report_deadlock_detection.pdf[Daniel Moser's semester project].

== Usage

=== Usage scenario 1

==== Step 1

At some point in time you wonder about having a deadlock in your custom engine domain model objects.
You transform your domain model objects into the (simple) jtrag/jtwfg model objects using a jtrag graph builder object:

[source,java]
----
GraphBuilder builder = new GraphBuilder();
builder.addTask2ResourceDependency("task 1", "resource 1");
builder.addResource2TaskAssignment("resource 1", "task 2");
builder.addTask2ResourceDependency("task 2", "resource 2");
builder.addResource2TaskAssignment("resource 2", "task 1");
builder.addTask("task 3");
builder.addTask("task 4");
builder.addResource("resource 3");
builder.addResource("resource 4");
Graph graph = builder.build();
----

==== Step 2

As soon as you have a jtwfg graph instance, you can use the jtwfg deadlock detector to find deadlocks:

[source,java]
----
DeadlockDetector deadlockDetector = new DeadlockDetector();
DeadlockAnalysisResult analyzisResult = deadlockDetector.analyze(graph);
if(analyzisResult.hasDeadlock()){
   // do something in your domain like throwing an exception or killing a task or ...
   //
   // System.out.println(analyzisResult)
}
----

=== Usage scenario 2: "Update the jtrag/jtwfg model" as you update your domain model objects and check for deadlocks on the fly

Probably you want to keep the jtrag/jtwfg model objects "in sync" with your domain model objects and check for deadlocks on the fly
as soon as you update your model objects. Probably you use various threads to update your domain model objects and the jtwfg model objects.

That's fine.

See link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/libs/jtrag/ExecutableDocumentation.groovy[executable documentation in src/test/groovy] for
this and more examples.

=== Thread-safety of jtrag/jtwfg

For simplicity and comfort, the jtrag/jtwfg 'GraphBuilder' and 'DeadlockDetector' classes are threadsafe.
See the documentation in the source code for more information about thread-safety.

If you would like to use jtwfg single-threaded and have performance issues, let me know.

=== Limitations of jtrag/jtwfg

* At the moment jtrag/jtwfg support only simple, synchronous dependencies in graphs.
* jtrag doesn't fully encapsulate jtwfg. Therefore you need to program using the jtrag *and* the https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg] API and understand both of them.
* The algorithms are not yet tuned and work more or less in a "brute force" manner. Please create a github issue if you have zillions of tasks/resources and run into performance/memory issues.

== Requirements

To use the *jtrag* library you need

* Java 8 or later

There is a transitive dependency to the https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg] library

== Installation

=== Usage in Gradle, Maven, ...

==== Gradle based build

Add the following dependency in your gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:jtrag:x.y.z' // replace x.y.z with the real version

    // or "latest", for the braves:
    //compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:jtrag:+'
}
----

==== Maven based build

Add jtrag as dependency to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>ch.petikoch.libs</groupId>
            <artifactId>jtrag</artifactId>
            <version>x.y.z</version> <!-- replace x.y.z with the real version -->
            <!-- or latest release (not snapshot), for the braves
            <version>RELEASE</version>
            -->
        </dependency>
----

== Release notes

See https://github.com/Petikoch/jtrag/releases.

== Support

Please use GitHub issues and pull requests for support.

== How to build the project

To run a build of the jtrag project on your machine, clone the git repo to your local machine and start the gradle based build using
gradle's http://gradleware.com/registered-access?content=screencasts%2Fthe-gradle-wrapper%2F[gradlewrapper] from the shell/command line:

[source]
----
> ./gradlew build
----

== My motivation to create jtrag

After I created first https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg], I had a use case involving tasks *and* _resources_.

Of course, this can be solved also with jtwfg: Every "task resource assignment graph" can be transformed
into a "task wait for graph". Just use tasks for resources.

But the API isn't very intuitive then. So I added the jtrag API on top of https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg],
which does the "transformation" for you.
